Dear Jane,

I was delighted to read you're letter last week. It's always a pleasure to recieve the latest news and to hear that you and your family had a great summer.

We spent last week at the beach and had so much fun on the sand and in the water exploring the coast. We weren't prepared for the rain that came at the end of the vacation. The best part of the trip was the opportunities to sightsee and relax.

My kids are back in school too. I find their are less things to worry about now that the kids are at school all day. There is plenty of fun things to do in the summer, but by August I'm running out of ideas. I've excepted the fact that we'll have to think up brand-new activities next summer; hoping to round up some creative ideas soon.

Thanks again for your letter!

Sincerely, Karen
