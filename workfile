Dear Jane,

I was delighted to read your letter last week. It's always a pleasure to recieve the latest news, and to hear that you and your family had a great summer.

We spent last week at the beach, and had so much fun in the sand and on the water exploring the coast. We weren't prepared for the rain that came at the end of the vacation. The best part of the trip was the opportunity to sightsee and relax.

My kids are back in school too. I find there are less things to worry about now that the kids are at school all day. There are plenty of fun things to do in the summer, but by August I'm running out of ideas. I've excepted the fact that we'll have to think up brand new activities next summer, hoping to round up some creative ideas soon.

Thanks again for your letter!

Sincerely,
Karen
